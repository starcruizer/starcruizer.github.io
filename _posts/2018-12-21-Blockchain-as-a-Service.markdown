# Stepping into the blockchain universe

Its the conventional winds as usual, during my winter break at Navi Mumbai, which were stopping me from taking showers early morning.

Keeping everything aside and focusing on technical aspects. I was gonna meet the Quayuam Quamar, CEO of  [SQR Infotech Pvt LTD](http://sqrinfotech.com) in Pune city. We were gonna make something interesting by combining the applications of blockchain and IoT. People at SQR we're doing lots of great stuff by leveraging the BaaS (Blockchain as a Service). These guys made whole commercially viable solutions to few critical problems in sectors like education, banking, health. Nevertheless these guys could develop blockchain enabled web & mobile application in no time, and that too cross- platform ðŸ˜®

I was dead serious in making something together by collaboration. After a few iterated meetups and discussions, I managed to have his attention. I have to admit that Mr. Sameer Gitay, Co-Founder and CTO of SQR was also interested and these great people use to harken to my ideas and solutions. Now we are currently working as partners in a project on indoor positioning without GPS.
