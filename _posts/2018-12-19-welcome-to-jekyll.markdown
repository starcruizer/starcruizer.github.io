# The Real Pochinki
Pune city has been known for developing rapidly and for having array of tourist attractions, the misty weather added to the scenic beauty of the city and made me visit a remote mountain just a few miles from my region of stay.

`Why?`
_cuz I don't like being surrounded with too many people. It makes me think slow and too many people's voices makes me forget things._

Anyway, the view from atop mountain reminded me of Pubg's favorite drop area aka Pochinki. Really, I' mean this how it looks like while jumping off (skydiving) the airplane at the beginning of the game
