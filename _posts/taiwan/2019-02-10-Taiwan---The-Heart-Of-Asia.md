>A cool thing about semesters in KIIT University is that they dont feel like semesters. More so after the freshman year.... :smile:

Few of students, including **`me`**, was selected for the Taiwan Semester Abroad program from my college. I was about to spend my sixth semester in a Nanhua University. Nanhua University is situated in the suburbs of Chiayi County, in a small township named Dalin. Let's pause there for a moment... **WOW** ... I mean when did s**t like that started to happen with me anyway.

I got super excited about the journey that I was about to embark upon. There was a lot to discuss and plan. Immediately I started exploiting *google search*  for the places to visit in Taiwan. Taipei, Taichung, Yilan, Hualien..... places just kept adding on my never-ending list. Although the trip's sole purpose was to provide international exposure and research opportunities to students, I and my friends were planning it as a **voyage** !  :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Interestingly, Stephen got into *super-work mode*, after hearing that he's also going to Taiwan. I remember that he started exploring different universities and colleges in Taiwan. Good for us, at least there was someone who took semester as it should have, unlike some, who took it as a vacation abroad :smile:.

## A blast to the past
I almost forgot to mention how I came into contact with Nanhua University, Taiwan. It was the month of April that I met with a visiting professor in KIIT. His name is Prof. Lai. He is the chairperson of the Computer Science department of Nanhua University and one of my best *friend*.  It was then, that he came along with two more professors, Prof. Wu (President) and Prof. Huang (Chair professor), to visit our department and see the exciting projects that student@KIIT were performing. This made him visit the IoT Lab. This was the first time I came into contact with him. Soon he was interested to see that we have been working a wide variety of projects. I explained to him most of the projects and he was surprised that if a sophomore could have done it. He was supposed to give a presentation on the Nanhua University along with Prof. Wu. Unfortunately, his laptop did not have the support for `HDMI`, but instead, he had `miniHDMI` support. He fished his bag but could not find a suitable adapter and to make the matter worse, he was already being looked upon by every faculty and president for delaying the presentation.

> It clicked! that there is only one such place in the whole department to find any sort of adapter - *THE IoT LAB*

Immediately I rushed to the lab and looked for the perfect match, and to my surprise, I found it. I ran back to the classroom and handed it over to Prof. Lai. I could hear his *sigh* of relief, and he said it works!.

This was the beginning of our friendship, that lasts till now and shall last for many more years to come.
