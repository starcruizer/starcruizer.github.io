This fall, I joined one of the Sigfox Hacking House, held at Taipei. __[Unabiz](https://unabiz.com){:target="_blank"}__ , a Sigfox operator in Taiwan and a __Massive IoT enabler__, was the organizer for the event.

The hacking house program is a technology business incubator, well at least according to them. As for my opinion, the program has only been running for one year so it felt more like student workshops. Thankfully I have had some experience with startups and venture ecosystem, so I understood the idea behind the hacking house program.

The first week was on-boarding sessions and introduction from, all the participants. We got to share our domain knowledge and past experiences. Basically this was the begin of the team formation for later activities.

## The human chain
- - - -

The first activity that all of us went through was that everyone was asked to get in line and hold hands of the next person. Sounds easy right, except that just after that we were asked to haphazardly mingle among each other and cross our arms, creating a human knot. Leading to something like this **shit** as the only rule of the game was that we cannot let go anyone.

The original idea was to get to know each other and form logical connections, but it ended in dreadful state of confusion. Anyway, let's move onto the next phase

## Tower building
- - - -

The teams were provided with sticks and tapes to build a tower, I guess my team performed very well in this challenge. Thus I realized that this task help us to know that how we perform as a team when we will be presented with real challenges.

After the task was complete, we did managed to pull off a prototype of the tower ( It was my sweet little Eiffel Tower). If I had to describe or was a three floor tower with base having largest area, decreasing as you move up. Pretty archaic.

## My team
- - - -
 My team mostly came from the students of NCTU EE graduate students. The team composed of Shih-Ya Cheng (Nick) , Yu Chun Chuang (Gina), Sirapop Nulanimnoi (Film) and [Stephen Masih](http://steph.co.in).
